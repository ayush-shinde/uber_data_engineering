    <h1>Uber Data Engineering Project</h1>
    <p>This project aims to analyze and process Uber trip data to uncover insights into urban mobility and improve ride-hailing services. Utilizing modern data engineering techniques, this repository contains scripts, notebooks, and applications for data collection, processing, and visualization.</p>
    
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>The Uber Data Engineering Project is designed to handle large volumes of ride-hailing data, applying data engineering best practices to extract meaningful information. It includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data Collection: Scripts for ingesting data from Uber's API.</li>
        <li>Data Processing: Pipelines for cleaning and structuring raw data.</li>
        <li>Data Analysis: Notebooks for conducting exploratory data analysis.</li>
        <li>Data Visualization: Tools for visualizing trends and patterns.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>To get started with this project, follow these steps:</p>
    <pre>
<code>git clone https://github.com/ayush-shinde/uber_data_engineering.git
cd uber_data_engineering
